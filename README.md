### **Part 1: Starting the Website Creation (2-Page Design for Funngro)**

**Goal:** Create two visually appealing and functional web pages for Funngro, focusing on the "Company/Teen" angle, with good UX and SEO principles in mind.

**Tools You'll Need:**

  * **Code Editor:** VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.
  * **Web Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox (for testing)
  * **Optional (for design inspiration/wireframing):** Figma, Adobe XD, or even pen and paper.

**Steps:**

1.  **Understand Funngro's Current Site (Crucial First Step):**

      * **Action:** Go to the current Funngro website. You **must** find this URL yourself, as it's not provided.
      * **What to look for:**
          * Their overall branding (colors, fonts, logo).
          * Their target audience (who are they speaking to?).
          * What services/products do they offer?
          * How is their current "Company" or "Teen" section structured, if it exists? If not, what's missing that these pages could provide?
          * What is their general tone and style?
      * **Take Notes\!** This will inform your design and content.

2.  **Plan Your 2 Pages (Content & Structure):**

      * **Page 1: "Funngro for Companies" (Example Title)**
          * **Purpose:** To explain how companies can benefit from Funngro (e.g., finding talent, CSR activities, engaging with youth).
          * **Possible Sections:**
              * Hero section (catchy headline, brief intro)
              * Benefits for companies (bullet points, clear value proposition)
              * How it works (simple steps)
              * Case studies/Testimonials (if you want to mock some up)
              * Call to Action (e.g., "Partner with Us," "Find Talent," "Learn More")
          * **Keywords:** "company partnerships," "youth talent," "internship programs," "CSR initiatives," "employer branding," "skill development."
      * **Page 2: "Funngro for Teens: Empowering Your Future" (Example Title)**
          * **Purpose:** To appeal to teenagers, showing them opportunities, learning, and growth with Funngro.
          * **Possible Sections:**
              * Hero section (engaging headline, relatable image/video concept)
              * What teens can gain (skills, opportunities, money, experience)
              * Types of opportunities (projects, internships, learning modules)
              * Success stories/Testimonials (mock some up)
              * How to get started (simple sign-up process)
              * Call to Action (e.g., "Join Now," "Explore Opportunities," "Start Your Journey")
          * **Keywords:** "teen jobs," "student internships," "skill development for youth," "earn online," "career guidance for teens," "youth projects."

3.  **Set Up Your Project Folder:**

      * Create a main folder, e.g., `funngro_website_project`.
      * Inside, create:
          * `index.html` (for Page 1)
          * `teens.html` (for Page 2, or whatever you name it)
          * `style.css` (for all your CSS)
          * `script.js` (for any JavaScript, if needed)
          * `images/` (folder for any images you'll use)

4.  **Basic HTML Structure (for each page):**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Funngro for Companies | Your Website</title> <meta name="description" content="Discover how Funngro helps companies connect with talented youth for projects and internships."> <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <nav>
                <a href="#">Funngro Logo</a>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="index.html">For Companies</a></li>
                    <li><a href="teens.html">For Teens</a></li>
                    </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h1>Funngro for Companies: Empowering Your Workforce</h1>
            <p>...</p>
            </main>

        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2025 Funngro. All rights reserved.</p>
        </footer>

        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

      * **Repeat this structure for `teens.html`, making sure to change the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` to be specific to the teen page.**

5.  **Start with Basic CSS (`style.css`):**

      * Define basic styles for `body`, `header`, `nav`, `footer`, `h1`, `p`, etc.
      * Use Funngro's brand colors (from your research in Step 1).
      * Start thinking about layout (Flexbox or Grid are great for modern layouts).
      * **Focus on responsiveness from the start using media queries.**

6.  **Develop Content:**

      * Write compelling copy for each section of both pages, integrating your chosen keywords naturally.
      * Think about calls to action (CTAs) â€“ what do you want the user to do on each page?

7.  **Implement SEO-Friendly Practices (as you build):**

      * **Title Tags & Meta Descriptions:** Make sure these are unique, compelling, and keyword-rich for *each* of your two pages.
      * **Header Structure:** Use `<h1>` once per page for the main topic, then `<h2>`, `<h3>` for sub-sections.
      * **Keywords:** Integrate keywords naturally in your copy. Don't stuff them\!
      * **Image Alt Text:** Add descriptive `alt` attributes to all images.
      * **Internal Links:** Link between your two pages (e.g., from "For Companies" page, have a clear link to "For Teens" page if relevant).
      * **Clean URLs:** Your file names (`index.html`, `teens.html`) are already good examples.

8.  **Test Locally:**

      * Open your `index.html` and `teens.html` files directly in your web browser.
      * Check responsiveness by resizing your browser window or using browser developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I, then toggle device toolbar).
